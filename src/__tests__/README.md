# Tests Directory

This directory will contain all test files:

- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual components and functions
- `property/` - Property-based tests using fast-check
- `integration/` - Integration tests for complete workflows
- `__mocks__/` - Mock implementations for testing

Tests will be implemented alongside their corresponding features.
